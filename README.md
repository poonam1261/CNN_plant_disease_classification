# CNN Plant Disease Classification

## Description

<p>✔ Plant disease detection is a machine learning (ML) project that uses images to identify and diagnose diseases in plants.<p/>
<p>✔ This can be helpful for farmers, plant enthusiasts, and researchers to monitor large fields of crops more easily and cheaply.<p/>
<p>✔ The project uses traditional ML techniques, such as feature extraction and classification, to train a classifier that can differentiate between healthy and diseased plants.<p/>
<p>✔ The classifier is trained on a dataset of images of healthy and diseased plants collected under controlled conditions.<p/>
